## Introduction

The client, a social media startup, would like an API for their social network that uses a NoSQL database so that their website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Problem

Given a social network API, when the client enters the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database. When the client opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When the client tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database. When the client tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then they are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
